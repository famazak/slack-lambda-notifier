# Slack Lambda Notifier
Script that contains a class for formatting SNS topic message from CloudWatch alarms and pushes a notification through to a Slack channel via Lambda

Need to set WEBHOOK_URL to the Slack webhook endpoint for the channel as well need to set CHANNEL to the desired Slack channel to post alerts in your workspace
